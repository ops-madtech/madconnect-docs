#### **Audience Schema Requirements for Meta Ads â€“ Custom Audiences**

To successfully send data to **Meta Custom Audiences** via **MadConnect**, the following minimum schema must be used:

**ID Field**

* **Field Name:** `email_hash`, `phone_hash`, `maid`
* **Data Type:** String (Hashed for emails and phone numbers; plain for MAID)
* **Description:** Contains the hashed emails, phone numbers, or plain Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) of the audience members.
* **Accepted Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-256
* **Example:**
  * Email: `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`
  * Phone: `98f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`
  * MAID: `cdda802e-fb9c-47ad-0794d394c912`

**Segment ID Field**

* **Field Name:** `segment_id`
* **Data Type:** String
* **Description:** The unique identifier for the specific audience segment assigned by Meta.
* **Example:** `987654321`

**Segment Name Field**

* **Field Name:** `segment_name`
* **Data Type:** String
* **Description:** The name of the audience segment to be created in Meta. If a `segment_id` is not provided, MadConnect will use the `segment_name` to create a new audience in Meta.
* **Example:** `Winter Campaign Audience`

**Action Field**

* **Field Name:** `action`
* **Data Type:** String
* **Description:** Specifies the intended action for the audience memberâ€”either adding or removing the user from the segment.

***

#### **ðŸ’¡ How the Schema Works in MadConnect:**

* **Audience Creation:**
  * If a `segment_name` is provided and `segment_id` is missing, MadConnect will automatically create a **new audience** in Meta using the provided name.
  * **Action must be `add`** when creating a new audience.
* **Managing Existing Audiences:**
  * If `segment_id` is provided, IDs will be **added** or **removed** based on the `action` field.
  * The **`id`** field serves as the matching identifier (e.g., `email_hash`, `UID2`, `MAID`), ensuring proper alignment with Metaâ€™s audience matching requirements.
* **UI Enhancements:**
  * When creating a new audience, additional fields (e.g., audience source, duration) can be configured directly within the **MadConnect UI**.
  * These settings can be updated at the **connection level** as needed.

#### **Audience Schema Requirements for Snapchat Ads â€“ Custom Audiences**

To successfully send data to **Snapchat Ads** as audiences via **MadConnect**, the following minimum schema must be used:

1. **ID Field**
   * **Field Name:** `email_sha256`, `email_sha256`, `maid_sha256`
   * **Data Type:** String (Hashed for personal identifiers; unhashed for MAIDs)
   * **Data :** String (Hashed for personal identifiers; unhashed for MAIDs)
   * **Description:**
     * Contains audience member identifiers used for matching in Snapchat.
     * **Only one type of identifier can be used per request** â€” mixing multiple identifier types (e.g., emails and phone numbers) in a single request is **not supported**.
   * **Supported ID Types:**
     * `email_sha256` â€“ SHA-256 hashed email addresses.
       * _Before hashing:_ Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase.
       * _Example:_ `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`
     * `email_sha256` â€“ SHA-256 hashed phone numbers.
       * _Before hashing:_ Remove symbols, letters, and leading zeroes. Include the country code if applicable.
       * _Example:_ `98f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6`
     * `maid_sha256` â€“ SHA-256 hashed Mobile Advertising ID (MAID).
       * _Example:_ `cdda802e-fb9c-47ad-0794d394c912`

ðŸ’¡ _For a complete list of supported match identifiers and formatting guidelines, review the official_ [_Snapchat Ads API Documentation_](https://developers.snap.com/api/marketing-api/Ads-API/customer-lists)_._

2. **Segment ID Field**
   * **Field Name:** `segment_id`
   * **Data Type:** String
   * **Description:**
     * The unique ID assigned by Snapchat Ads for the specific audience segment.
     * Used for adding/removing members from existing audiences.
     * _Example:_ `123456`
3. **Segment Name Field**
   * **Field Name:** `segment_name`
   * **Data Type:** String
   * **Description:**
     * The name of the audience to be created in Snapchat.
     * If a `segment_id` is not provided, MadConnect will use the `segment_name` to create a new audience in Snapchat and return the assigned `segment_id`.
     * _Example:_ `Holiday Campaign Audience`
4. **Action Field**
   * **Field Name:** `action`
   * **Data Type:** String
   * **Description:**
     * Specifies whether to **add** or **remove** the user from the audience.

     * **Accepted Values:** `add`, `remove`
     * _Example:_ `add`

***

#### **ðŸ’¡ How the Schema Works in MadConnect:**

1. **Audience Creation:**
   * If a **`segment_name`** is provided and **`segment_id`** is not, MadConnect will **create a new audience** in Snapchat using the provided name.
   * The **`action`** field must be set to `add` during audience creation.
2. **Managing Existing Audiences:**
   * If a **`segment_id`** exists, IDs will be **added or removed** based on the **`action`** field.
   * **Only one identifier type can be used per request.** For example, a request can include only **hashed emails** or only **hashed phone numbers**, but not both.
3. **Continuous Audience Updates:**
   * Users can be **added to a segment at any time**.
   * Snapchat supports flexible matching using either **email**, **phone number**, or **mobile advertising IDs**, but only **one type per request**.
4. **UI Enhancements:**
   * Users can configure additional metadata (e.g., **audience source**, **lifespan**) using drop downs in the **MadConnect UI**.
   * These settings can be modified at the **connection level** as needed.

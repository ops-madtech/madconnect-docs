#### **ðŸ’¡ How the Schema Works in MadConnect:**

1. **Audience Creation:**
   * If a **`segment_name`** is provided and **`segment_id`** is not, MadConnect will **create a new audience** in TikTok using the provided name.
   * The **`action`** field must be set to `add` during audience creation.
2. **Managing Existing Audiences:**
   * If a **`segment_id`** exists, IDs will be **added or removed** based on the **`action`** field.
   * **Any valid ID field sent to TikTok that the platform supports will be used for matching.** This includes hashed emails, hashed phone numbers, and MAIDs.
3. **UI Enhancements:**
   * Users can configure additional metadata (e.g., **audience source**, **lifespan**) via drop downs in the **MadConnect UI**.
   * These settings can be modified at the **connection level** as needed.

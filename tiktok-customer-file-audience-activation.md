### **ðŸ’¡ How the Schema Works in MadConnect:**

1. **Audience Creation:**
   * If a **`segment_name`** is provided and **`segment_id`** is not, MadConnect will **create a new audience** in TikTok using the provided name.
   * The **`action`** field must be set to `add` during audience creation.
2. **Managing Existing Audiences:**
   * If a **`segment_id`** exists, IDs will be **added or removed** based on the **`action`** field.
   * Multiple identifiers can be included in a single request (e.g., **email**, **phone**, and **MAID**) to maximize match rates.
3. **Accepted Hashing Algorithm:**
   * **SHA-256** is required for **emails** and **phone numbers**.
   * **MAIDs** can be uploaded in plain text or hashed using SHA-256.
4. **Data Normalization Before Hashing:**
   * **Email:**
     * Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase.
     * Normalize by removing '+' and any following characters before '@'.
     * Remove all '.' characters in the username before '@'.
   * **Phone:**
     * Remove symbols, letters, and leading zeroes.
     * Include the country code if applicable.
   * **MAID:**
     * Can be uploaded unhashed or hashed.

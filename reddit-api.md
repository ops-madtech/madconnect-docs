### **Schema Requirements for Reddit Ads â€“ Audience Connector**

To successfully sync data with **Reddit Ads** via **MadConnect**, the following schema must be used:

* **ID Field**
  * **Field Name:** `email_hash`, `maid_hash`
  * **Data Type:** String (Hashed)
  * **Description:** Contains the hashed emails and/or Mobile Advertising IDs (MAIDs) used for audience matching.
    * **Both identifiers can be uploaded together** in the same request to improve match accuracy.
  * **Accepted Identifiers:**
    * **`email_hash`** â€“ SHA-256 hashed email addresses.
    * **`maid_hash`** â€“ SHA-256 hashed Mobile Advertising IDs.
  * **Example:**
    * Email: `5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592`
    * MAID: `cdda802e-fb9c-47ad-0794d394c912`
* **Segment ID Field**
  * **Field Name:** `segment_id`
  * **Data Type:** String
  * **Description:** The unique identifier assigned by Reddit Ads for the specific audience segment.
    * Used for adding/removing members from existing audiences.
  * **Example:** `123456789`
* **Segment Name Field**
  * **Field Name:** `segment_name`
  * **Data Type:** String
  * **Description:** The name of the audience to be created in Reddit Ads.
    * If a `segment_id` is not provided, MadConnect will use the `segment_name` to create a new audience in Reddit and return the assigned `segment_id`.
  * **Example:** `Holiday Promo Audience`
* **Action Field**
  * **Field Name:** `action`
  * **Data Type:** String
  * **Description:** Specifies whether to **add** or **remove** the user from the audience.
    * Required for both audience creation and member management.
  * **Accepted Values:** `add`, `remove`
  * **Example:** `add`

***

### **ðŸ’¡ How the Schema Works in MadConnect:**

1. **Audience Creation:**
   * If a **`segment_name`** is provided and **`segment_id`** is not, MadConnect will **create a new audience** in Reddit Ads using the provided name.
   * The **`action`** field must be set to `add` during audience creation.
2. **Managing Existing Audiences:**
   * If a **`segment_id`** exists, IDs will be **added or removed** based on the **`action`** field.
   * **Both hashed emails and MAIDs can be included in a single request** to optimize audience matching.
3. **Accepted Hashing Algorithm:**
   * **SHA-256** is required for both **emails** and **MAIDs**.
4. **Data Normalization Before Hashing:**
   * **Email:**
     * Remove whitespace and convert to lowercase.
     * _Example:_ `Example.Email+test@gmail.com` â†’ `exampleemail@gmail.com`
   * **MAID:**
     * Remove whitespace and ensure all letters are lowercase before hashing.
